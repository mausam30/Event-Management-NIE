# College Event Management System

Welcome to the College Event Management System! This fully functional platform, developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and MySQL, is specifically crafted to efficiently manage and showcase college events. The system operates in two distinct modes:

## User Mode
In User Mode, registered users can log in to the website to access detailed information about upcoming events. Convenient links are provided, redirecting users to specific event sites for additional details.

## Admin Mode
Reserved for administrators, Admin Mode empowers them to seamlessly add and delete events and locations. Admins play a crucial role in reviewing and approving or rejecting event submissions.

Events are intelligently displayed in a sorted manner based on calendar dates and times, ensuring a user-friendly and organized experience. This comprehensive system not only caters to the curiosity of attendees but also streamlines the administrative process, making event management within the college community smooth and effective.
